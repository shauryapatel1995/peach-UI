# peach
cs535 dsp architecture project 
We will be implementing FFT in binary.

# Next steps 
1. Figure out what to add for instruction parsing 
    - Which instructions to add as per benchmark program. 

2. Pipeline Implementation - refer to Charles email for how to implement this. 
    - We should have an instruction object that will simulate the wait for each stage on the pipe.
    - The instruction object should check at each stage if the next one is complete 

2. GUI 

3. Benchmark program
